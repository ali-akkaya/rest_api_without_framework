This input is most often delivered through firm holding, cuddling, hugging, firm stroking, and squeezing.\n\nHowever, before we get into too much detail about deep touch pressure, we need to understand our bodyâ€™s sensory system and why deep touch pressure emerged in the first place.\n\nNeurologically, sensory processing is how we feel.
